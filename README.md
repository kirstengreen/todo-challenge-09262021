## Overview

This todo list app was presented as a coding challege. I was given a Figma mockup and tasked to recreate the design and desired functionality using the tech of my choice (React,Vue, or vanilia JS). I chose React because it is the JS framework that I have been focusing my professional development on recently. This project would give me another chance to test my growing skillset.

## How to Use

* Clone repo from Code dropdown
* run npm install - to install dependencies 
* npm start - to run development server

## Technology

* React
* JavaScript
* HTML & CSS

## Known Issues

* Create item input design is not complete
* Filter active state not active 

## Understanding the Challenge

Before I begain coding, I wanted to make sure I understood the app structure and what features I needed to build. I did a sketch in Goodnotes before jumping into the code.

## What I Learned

* I created a filtered list for the first time
* I learned how important it is to understand how different interactions interact with each other and effect state

## What I Want to Improve

* Fix bugs!
* Learn to map out interactions and know how they link together/effect eachother. I created many avoidable bugs by creating certain features before or not considering others.
* Use SCSS and SCSS mixins. It would have made conditional rendering easier and more future proof
* Find a better way to implement conditional rendering for components and CSS. Files were getting a little unwieldy and I feel like there was a simplier way to do things
* Complete a general file cleanup and find ways to simplify and make the code more DRY
